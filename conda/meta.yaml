  summary: 'NIFTy Gridder - CUDA implementation'
  description: |
   This repository contains of an in-progress parallelised prototype of the Numerical Information Field Theory (NIFTy) based gridding algorithm for wide-field radio telescope imaging systems. The NIFTy gridder is a composition of an analytical exponential of semicircle gridding kernel (as presented in this research paper), and the improved w-stacking method (as presented on page 139 in this thesis). This implemention approximately follows a C++ implementation of NIFTy gridder (available from this repository).
